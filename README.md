# 30DaysOfJavaScript

I am taking part in the 30 days of Javascript challenge.

Unlikely that I will complete it in 30 days due to work but that's ok!
I will compelte it one way or another.

Pushing update to READMEmd as a test to check that my github email is linked again to git on my desktop again
